Given a topic and some content, analyze and understand the content to provide a high-level overview aimed at teaching a student the major points.

Requirements:
Content Analysis and Breakdown:
Identify high-level subtopics that represent major themes or sections of the content.
Avoid listing overly minor or detailed subtopics; focus on significant parts of the content.
Dynamically generate subtopics based on the content provided without hardcoding specific headings.
Mention key terms and definitions in the overview.
Tailor the number of subtopics to the content's length (typically 5-10, or more for lengthy material).
Include Introduction as the first subtopic and Conclusion as the final subtopic.
Before the Introduction, list concepts that need to be learned prior to the given content.
Also mention to what level the prior concepts need to be known (On a scale of Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, and Expert).
Give resources/links/youtube videos to where you can learn the prior concepts.

Teaching-Oriented Overview:
Provide a high-level overview of the content, summarizing and explaining the major points.
If provided, use the learning objectives to get the key takeaways from the content.
The overview should be detailed enough to prepare a student to understand and engage with the content effectively when learning from their professor later.
Use examples, analogies, and helpful tricks to make the content engaging and easier to grasp.
Spark interest in the subject while maintaining clarity and depth.
Ensure the overview is not too vague and covers each part of the content comprehensively.

Subsections and Format:
Split the overview into multiple subsections based on the subtopics identified.
Separate each subsection with a markdown divider (---).

Content Presentation and Formatting Guidelines:
Use appropriate examples, formulas, equations, diagrams, and tables to enhance understanding.
Follow these strict formatting rules:
Tables: Use KaTeX syntax for tables.
Start each table with [LATEX START] and end it with [LATEX END].
Never use LaTeX tabular or any LaTeX-specific table formatting.
Use \begin{array} instead.
Only use KaTeX formatting for the tables and not the markdown table style. 
Only add tables if they are simple and absolutely necessary.
In place of complex tables, explain it verbally.
Equations/Symbols: Format all symbols and equations using markdown LaTeX syntax.
Diagrams: Use LaTeX syntax that works within GitHub markdown for diagrams.
Only add diagrams if they are simple and absolutely necessary.
In place of complex diagrams, explain it verbally.
Start each diagram with [LATEX START] and end it with [LATEX END].
