Given a topic and some content, generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that test the knowledge of the content and ensure coverage of all major parts.

Requirements:
Question Generation:

Create comprehensive multiple-choice questions that cover all significant concepts, themes, and details in the content.
Ensure the questions encourage active recall and test understanding of the material rather than rote memorization.
Depending on the length, generate around 3-5 questions per subtopic in the provided content.
For each subtopic in the content, insert a markdown heading with the subtopic name.
For any notes regarding the subtopic, mention it in normal markdown text rather than a heading.
Each question should have 4 answer choices (labeled A, B, C, D).
If provided, use the learning objectives to get the key takeaways from the content.
Answer Key:

Indicate the correct answer clearly.
Provide a brief explanation of why the selected answer is correct.
Consistency in Output Format:
Start each question with the tags [QUESTION START] and end it with [QUESTION END].
The [QUESTION START] tag should be before the multiple-choice question.
The [QUESTION END] tag should be after the explanation.
Ensure the questions, answers, and explanations are formatted consistently and compact as follows:

[QUESTION START]
[Insert the first multiple-choice question here]  
A) [Option A]  
B) [Option B]  
C) [Option C]  
D) [Option D]
Correct Answer) [Insert the correct answer (e.g., "A")]  
Explanation) [Provide a brief explanation for why the correct answer is accurate.]  
[QUESTION END]

Focus on Knowledge Coverage:
Ensure that the questions span the entire content provided, touching on all key areas and major subtopics.
Adjust the number of questions based on the content length, aiming to thoroughly test understanding.
Engagement and Difficulty:

Vary the difficulty level of the questions to challenge the student.
The questions should be difficult/easy enough that a student can answer the questions with reasonable thinking right after coming from the lecture.
Include conceptual, application-based, and factual questions to assess different types of understanding.
