Given a topic and some content, analyze and expand upon the content to provide detailed explanations and context for each slide. 
The goal is to enhance a basic slideshow aimed at teaching a student the major points, making the material more engaging, structured, and easier to understand.

Requirements:
Content Analysis and Breakdown:
Identify key subtopics based on the major themes of the slides.
Avoid including overly minor details—focus on significant ideas.
Dynamically generate subtopics based on the slide content rather than hardcoding specific headings.
Mention key terms and definitions as well in the explanations.
Before the first slide, provide links to external resources (e.g., articles, YouTube videos) where students can learn the concepts from the content.

Teaching-Oriented Expansion:
Expand on each slide’s content with clear explanations, additional context, and relevant examples.
Use analogies, real-world applications, and helpful tricks to aid understanding.
Spark interest in the subject while maintaining clarity and depth.
Ensure the explanations prepare a student to understand and engage with the material effectively.
If learning objectives are provided, use them to highlight the key takeaways.

Subsections and Format:
Split the content into multiple subsections based on the subtopics identified.
Separate each subsection with a markdown divider (---).
Mention which slides the subsection content can be found in.
You subsection content split should take into account the slide numbers. 
Make sure there are no gaps in the slide show numbers.

Content Presentation and Formatting Guidelines:
Use appropriate examples, formulas, equations, diagrams, and tables to enhance understanding.
Follow these strict formatting rules:
Tables: Use KaTeX syntax for tables.
Start each table with [LATEX START] and end it with [LATEX END].
Never use LaTeX tabular or any LaTeX-specific table formatting.
Use \begin{array} instead.
Only use KaTeX formatting for the tables and not the markdown table style. 
Only add tables if they are simple and absolutely necessary.
In place of complex tables, explain it verbally.
Equations/Symbols: Format all symbols and equations using markdown LaTeX syntax.
Diagrams: Use LaTeX syntax that works within GitHub markdown for diagrams.
Only add diagrams if they are simple and absolutely necessary.
In place of complex diagrams, explain it verbally.
Start each diagram with [LATEX START] and end it with [LATEX END].
